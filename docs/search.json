    "section": "",
    "text": "About Praevius: AI Cost Control for Construction Subcontractors\n\n20 years of construction cost management expertise, now powered by AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Story\n\n\n\nPraevius (from Latin “praevius” meaning “going before”) was born from a simple observation: construction subcontractors are drowning in spreadsheets while enterprise platforms price them out of modern cost control.\n\n\nAfter two decades working as a quantity surveyor across the UK, Australia, and Poland—handling everything from 500K fitouts to 50M commercial developments—the pattern became undeniable. Specialty trade contractors, the backbone of every construction project, were consistently:\n\n\n\nLosing 3-5% margins to poor variation tracking\n\n\nWasting 10+ hours monthly on manual billing cycles\n\n\nDiscovering cost overruns weeks after they could have acted\n\n\nBeing priced out of tools designed for general contractors\n\n\n\nPraevius is the solution: professional-grade cost control without enterprise complexity. Simple enough to learn in hours, powerful enough to replace spreadsheet chaos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Quantity Surveying Software Needed to Change\n\n\n\nTraditional quantity surveying software was designed for enterprise clients with dedicated IT teams and training budgets. That left mid-market contractors with two options: expensive platforms that required weeks of training, or spreadsheets that created more problems than they solved.\n\n\nThe construction industry loses billions annually to:\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet errors - 88% of spreadsheets contain errors (KPMG study)\n\n\nPoor cash flow visibility - Only 12% of contractors get paid on time\n\n\nMissed variations - Change orders represent 8-14% of project value\n\n\nReactive cost control - Problems discovered weeks after they occurred\n\n\n\nPraevius bridges this gap: professional-grade construction cost control software with mid-market pricing and learning curves measured in hours, not weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Uses Praevius?\n\n\n\n\n Electrical Contractors\n\n\nManaging 10-50 concurrent projects with complex variation tracking and progress billing requirements. Track every cable run, switchboard, and conduit installation.\n\n\n\n\n Mechanical & Plumbing Subcontractors\n\n\nTracking variations across multiple job sites with different billing cycles and retention requirements. Never lose track of a variation again.\n\n\n\n\n Growing QS Practices\n\n\nQuantity surveying practices serving multiple clients simultaneously need professional tools that scale without enterprise complexity.\n\n\n\n\n Trade Contractors Outgrowing Spreadsheets\n\n\nSpecialty trades who’ve hit the limits of Excel but don’t need—or can’t afford—Procore-level solutions.\n\n\n\n\nWhether you’re a specialty contractor in the UK, Australia, or expanding internationally, Praevius adapts to your progress claim requirements and local billing formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n Proactive, Not Reactive\n\n\nThe best cost control happens before problems arise.
