Specialty trade contractors, the backbone of every construction project, were consistently:\n\n\n\nLosing 3-5% margins to poor variation tracking\n\n\nWasting 10+ hours monthly on manual billing cycles\n\n\nDiscovering cost overruns weeks after they could have acted\n\n\nBeing priced out of tools designed for general contractors\n\n\n\nPraevius is the solution: professional-grade cost control without enterprise complexity. Simple enough to learn in hours, powerful enough to replace spreadsheet chaos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n Proactive, Not Reactive\n\n\nThe best cost control happens before problems arise.
