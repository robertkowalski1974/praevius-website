    "text": "Built by Practitioners, for Practitioners\n\n20 years of construction cost management expertise, now powered by AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Story\n\n\n\nPraevius (from Latin “praevius” meaning “going before”) was born from a simple observation: construction subcontractors are drowning in spreadsheets while enterprise platforms price them out of modern cost control.\n\n\nAfter two decades working as a quantity surveyor across the UK, Australia, and Poland—handling everything from £500K fitouts to £50M commercial developments—the pattern became undeniable. Specialty trade contractors, the backbone of every construction project, were consistently:\n\n\n\nLosing 3-5% margins to poor variation tracking\n\n\nWasting 10+ hours monthly on manual billing cycles\n\n\nDiscovering cost overruns weeks after they could have acted\n\n\nBeing priced out of tools designed for general contractors\n\n\n\nPraevius is the solution: professional-grade cost control without enterprise complexity. Simple enough to learn in hours, powerful enough to replace spreadsheet chaos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n Proactive, Not Reactive\n\n\nThe best cost control happens before problems arise.
