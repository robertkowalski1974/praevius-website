<h2 class="section-title">The <span>Story</span></h2>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.8;">

<p>Praevius (from Latin "praevius" meaning "going before") was born from a simple observation: construction subcontractors are drowning in spreadsheets while enterprise platforms price them out of modern cost control.</p>

<p>After two decades working as a quantity surveyor across the UK, Australia, and Poland—handling everything from 500K fitouts to 50M commercial developments—the pattern became undeniable. Specialty trade contractors, the backbone of every construction project, were consistently:</p>

<ul style="margin: 2rem 0;">
<li>Losing 3-5% margins to poor variation tracking</li>
<li>Wasting 10+ hours monthly on manual billing cycles</li>
<li>Discovering cost overruns weeks after they could have acted</li>
<li>Being priced out of tools designed for general contractors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Praevius is the solution:</strong> professional-grade cost control without enterprise complexity. Simple enough to learn in hours, powerful enough to replace spreadsheet chaos.</p>
