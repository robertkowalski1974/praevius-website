# About Praevius: <span class="highlight">AI Cost Control for Construction Subcontractors</span>

<p class="tagline">20 years of construction cost management expertise, now powered by AI.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The <span>Story</span></h2>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.8;">

<p>Praevius (from Latin "praevius" meaning "going before") was born from a simple observation: construction subcontractors are drowning in spreadsheets while enterprise platforms price them out of modern cost control.</p>

<p>After two decades working as a quantity surveyor across the UK, Australia, and Poland—handling everything from 500K fitouts to 50M commercial developments—the pattern became undeniable. Specialty trade contractors, the backbone of every construction project, were consistently:</p>

<ul style="margin: 2rem 0;">
<li>Losing 3-5% margins to poor variation tracking</li>
<li>Wasting 10+ hours monthly on manual billing cycles</li>
<li>Discovering cost overruns weeks after they could have acted</li>
<li>Being priced out of tools designed for general contractors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Praevius is the solution:</strong> professional-grade cost control without enterprise complexity. Simple enough to learn in hours, powerful enough to replace spreadsheet chaos.</p>

<!-- Why QS Software Needed to Change -->
<div class="section section-gray">

<h2 class="section-title">Why <span>Quantity Surveying Software</span> Needed to Change</h2>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.8;">

<p>Traditional <strong>quantity surveying software</strong> was designed for enterprise clients with dedicated IT teams and training budgets. That left mid-market contractors with two options: expensive platforms that required weeks of training, or spreadsheets that created more problems than they solved.</p>

<p>The construction industry loses billions annually to:</p>

<ul style="margin: 2rem 0;">
<li><strong>Spreadsheet errors</strong> - 88% of spreadsheets contain errors (KPMG study)</li>
<li><strong>Poor cash flow visibility</strong> - Only 12% of contractors get paid on time</li>
<li><strong>Missed variations</strong> - Change orders represent 8-14% of project value</li>
<li><strong>Reactive cost control</strong> - Problems discovered weeks after they occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>Praevius bridges this gap: <strong>professional-grade construction cost control software</strong> with mid-market pricing and learning curves measured in hours, not weeks.</p>
